Hi. I hope you liked our Home Page.
<P>
In the past few years, I have been teaching 
neural networks and systems, analog VLSI, and linear, adaptive, and
nonlinear control classes.
<P>
At the SCANN lab, we are doing exciting research in the design and
implementation of neural networks and systems. We
are interested in coupling the theory with the implementation of intelligent,
data-driven systems. Our designs focus on learning algorithms, modularity, and
ease of interface to other modules. My research interest also includes:
<UL>
<li>Nonlinear phenomena and chaos
<li>Adaptive control systems
</ul>
